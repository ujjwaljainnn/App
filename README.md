The story behind this app--->
I remember, when I was in high school, my teachers would always come late to the class in the first period because they had to go to the administration building to sign a register to mark their attendance. They used to complain how far they had to go each day only to sign and write the time they entered. Now, what if this attendance marking process is automated? What if the teachers don’t have to go anywhere, and as soon as they enter the school premises, they would be automatically marked present. That’s exactly what Attendo does. Attendo is a mobile application which uses Radar’s brilliant geofencing technology to automate the attendance marking of employees, be it teachers, nurses, programmers, receptionists, basically any employee who has to mark their attendance.

Employers can set a geofence around their office building. Whenever an employee enters or exits this geofence, the time at which they entered/exited is updated on the server. The employer can see who all are currently checked in, meaning who all are currently in the geofence, as well as the past-history of all the employees, which would include whether they exited/entered as well as the time when they did it.

The employees can see their status, which includes whether they are checked in/checked out,  as well as their personal past history. 

Attendo makes life easier for both employers and employees, as employers can easily know the past history of their employees in order to calculate the pay of the employees, as well as know who all are currently checked in by a couple of clicks, and employees just need to switch their phone’s GPS on and their attendance will be marked.
